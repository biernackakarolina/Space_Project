The Applied Data Science Capstone Project

Project Scenario: The commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. The most successful is SpaceX. One reason is that SpaceX rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Sometimes the first stage does not land. Sometimes it will crash as shown in this clip. Other times, Space X will sacrifice the first stageâ€¯due to the mission parameters like payload, orbit, and customer. This is a data science project for a new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX. The project aim is to determine the price of each launch. I gathered information about Space X and created dashboards for the team and trained a machine learning model and used public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
